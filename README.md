git branch

- `git branch`: list all branches on your local computer, and the current branch shows as green with a star
- `git branch <name>`: create a new branch named '<name>' locally, where 'HEAD' is
- `git switch b1`: switch to the branch b1
- `git log --oneline`: see where you are now
- `git log --oneline --graph`: help you see the commit/branch entries
(after add and commit:)
